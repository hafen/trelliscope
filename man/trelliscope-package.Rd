\title{Trelliscope: Create and Navigate Large Multi-Panel Visual Displays}
\description{
An extension of Trellis Display that enables creation,
organization, and interactive viewing of multi-panel displays created
against potentially very large data sets.  The dynamic viewer tiles
panels of a display across the screen in a web browser and allows the
user to interactively page through the panels and sort and filter them
based on "cognostic" metrics computed for each panel.  Panels can be
created using many of R's plotting capabilities, including base R
graphics, lattice, ggplot2, and many htmlwidgets.  Conditioning is
handled through the datadr package, which enables Trelliscope displays
with potentially millions of panels to be created against terabytes of
data on systems like Hadoop.  While designed to scale, Trelliscope
displays can also be very useful for small datasets.
